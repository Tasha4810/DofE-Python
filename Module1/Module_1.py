not coding from the middle of a field!
I am feeling ðŸ¥³

# Quiz Module 1: This contains the answers to my end of module quiz
# ===============================================================
#1 PRINT("Hello") - this wont work as print is written in capital
#2 print (my name is sam) - won't work as it is missing the quotation marks inside the brackets at the start and end
#3 print("I am 13 years old" - this won't work as it is missing a bracket at the end


# Hey Tasha, James here.
# I am going to be adding some comments to the end of your files after I've finished looking at them :), hope that's okay.
# I learned something from looking at this as I was not aware that Python would retain new-line characters in my .py files
# and then include them in the print() formatting. It makes a lot of sense though.

# I can see that you have got the hand of the syntax as all the Quiz Module 1 questions are correct.
